Recombining Split Files using 7-Zip on Windows
Method 1: Using Windows File Explorer
Install 7-Zip: If you haven't already, download and install 7-Zip from the official website.

Organize the Split Files: Move all the split files into a single folder. Ensure the folder only contains the split files you want to merge.

Open the Folder: Access the folder containing the split files using Windows File Explorer.

Select Split Files: Click on the first split file (with the lowest suffix, e.g., output.z01). Then, press Ctrl + A to select all the split files in the folder.

Merge the Files: Right-click on the selected files and navigate through the context menu: 7-Zip > Extract Here.

7-Zip will automatically merge the split files into a single file. The merged file will appear in the same folder as the split files.

Method 2: Using 7-Zip File Manager
Launch 7-Zip File Manager: Open the 7-Zip File Manager and find the folder that has your split files.

Select the First Split File: Click on the first split file in the sequence (e.g., output.z01).

Combine the Files: Right-click on the file you selected, and choose Combine files from the context menu.

Specify Destination: Pick the desired folder for the merged file and click OK.

7-Zip will combine the split files back into the original file, saving it in the chosen destination folder.

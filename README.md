To recombine the split files into the original file using 7-Zip on a Windows machine, follow these steps:
	1	Install 7-Zip if you haven't already. You can download it from the official website: https://www.7-zip.org/
	2	Move all the split files into a single folder. Make sure that the folder contains only the split files you want to merge.
	3	Open the folder containing the split files in Windows File Explorer.
	4	Select the first split file (with the lowest suffix, e.g., output.z01). Press Ctrl + A to select all the split files in the folder.
	5	Right-click on the selected files and choose 7-Zip > Extract Here from the context menu.

7-Zip will automatically merge the split files into a single file. The merged file will be created in the same folder as the split files

Alternatively, you can use the 7-Zip File Manager to recombine the files:
	1	Launch the 7-Zip File Manager and navigate to the folder containing the split files.
	2	Select the first split file in the sequence (e.g., output.z01).
	3	Right-click on the selected file and choose Combine files from the context menu8.
	4	Choose the destination folder for the merged file and click OK.

7-Zip will merge the split files into the original file, which will be saved in the specified destination folder.
